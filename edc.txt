Embedded Display Controller

vendor: 0x59EA5742 - Meisaka
device: 0xED73E4FF - EDC

version code determines the display size and characteristics
bit 15 <--- ---- ---- ---> 0
       xxxx MMVI frrc cccc
x - reserved bits (always zero)
MM - cell size, always 01 - 8x5 pixel cells, with 1 pixel spacing
VI - media type:
 11 = inverted LCD with backlight (active pixels are backlight color)
 10 = VFD (active pixels glow VFD color)
 01 = LCD with backlight (active pixels are dark)
 00 = reflective LCD (active pixels are dark)

f - Firmware version, always 0
rr - text cell line count, lines = rr + 1
ccccc - text cell column count, columns = ccccc * 4

Common values:
0x0402 - 1x8 cell, reflective LCD
0x052A - 2x40 cell, backlit LCD
0x0534 - 2x80 cell, backlit LCD
0x0625 - 2x20 cell, VFD

Interrupt commands:
0x0000 - display control: bits in A register set display options
  - bit 0 - Display power - 0 off / 1 on
  - bit 1 - Backlight power - 0 off / 1 on (ignored if not present)
  - bit 2 - Cursor display - 0 off / 1 on
  - bit 3 - Cursor blink - 0 steady / 1 blink
  - bit 4 - Cursor style - 0 block / 1 underscore
  - other bits ignored by the display
0x0001 - cursor address: set the cursor address to teh value
  - in the A register.
  - line 0 always starts at 0x0000
  - line 1 always starts at 0x0080
  - line 2 always starts at 0x0100
  - line 3 always starts at 0x0180
  - glyph ram starts at 0x0200
  - values above 0x03ff are ignored and do not affect the display.
  - values beyond the right of the visible space will put cursor the
    offscreen, the next charactor written will not be visible, and will reset
    the cursor to the beginning of the next line.
  - when the cursor is set to glyph ram it will count up each write until it
    reaches the end of glyph ram at 0x0400, at that point it will return to
    address 0x0000
0x0002 - reset control: value in A register controls what actions to take:
  - bit 0 - Clear screen if set
  - bit 1 - Home cursor to address 0 if set
0x0003 - write display: value in A register is written as follows:
  - bits 0-7 - character to display
     - 0x00 - 0x7f built in font glyphs
     - 0x80 - 0xff character ram glyphs
  - bit 8 - if set, don't advance cursor (overwrite)
  - when the cursor is in glyph ram, writes entire 16 bit value and advances.
0xffff - restart display, reset all display settings and RAM to zero.

The glyph RAM holds up to 128 custom raster glyphs, each glyph is 4 words.
Glyphs are rastered by the display horizontally, 8 bits per cell row.
on the standard 5x8 cell this is:
word 0, bits 0-4, are row 1, columns 1-5
word 0, bits 8-12 are row 2, columns 1-5
word 1, bits 0-4 are row 3, columns 1-5
word 1, bits 8-12 are row 4, columns 1-5
word 2, bits 0-4 are row 5, columns 1-5
word 2, bits 8-12 are row 6, columns 1-5
word 3, bits 0-4, are row 7, columns 1-5
word 3, bits 8-12 are row 8, columns 1-5

The cursor, when visible, always appears over the glyph (logical or).
The standard glyph font represents visible ASCII characters from 0x20-0x7f,
glyphs from 0x00-0x1f are supplimental graphic characters, the display does
not follow the concept of ASCII control characters.
